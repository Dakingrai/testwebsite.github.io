    <p>Hi, I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a> advised by <a href="https://ziyuyao.org/"> Prof. Ziyu Yao</a>. I’m interested in understanding how language models work and applying those insights to practical applications such as improving improve their capabilities and controllability.  </p>
    
    <p> My recent work focuses on exploring the internal mechanisms of language models through <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02646"> mechanistic interpretability (MI) </a>, where I'm currently interested in developing a top-down MI framework for explaining model behaviors across levels of analysis, from mechanistic components (e.g., features, circuits) to high-level cognitive-like behaviors (e.g., reasoning). This is motivated by the uncertainty that low-level understanding will explain higher-level emergent behaviors. </p>
